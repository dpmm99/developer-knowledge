<h1>Facts, Ideas, and Principles for Becoming Your Best (Software Developer) Self</h1>
<p>There is a vast amount of knowledge in the world, but much of it is sparsely distributed through wordy blog entries, articles, and books. The authors of these writings, as good authors tend to do, offer many examples and in-depth discussion of the concepts. However, most compositions cover a limited selection of concepts within the composition's already limited scope. This is not conducive to already knowledgeable individuals refreshing their knowledge or looking for realizations that have thus far escaped their judgment, nor does it function as guidance for novices seeking direction. As such, I offer this dense collection of a broad variety of facts, ideas, and principles in the hope that it can be a powerful, concise reference for experienced software developers (and related individuals) in their journey to become masters of all things surrounding their profession.</p>
<p>This page provides checkboxes to record your progress as you read individual items. The date and time of the moment you check each checkbox is saved in local storage. Because one can read through the items at any level or read the high-level items in one pass and the lower-level ones in another pass, consider each checkbox to apply only to the text directly adjacent to it.</p>

-----------------------------------
Knowledge items that need formatted
-----------------------------------

Being a great developer requires considering the human aspects of yourself, your teammates, your manager, and the users.
 
Deflect subtly and play the politics game, keeping the customer's best interests in mind.

People hire based on technologies despite that what programmers do best is learn new tech. As such, knowing old languages like COBOL can land you a high-paid position.
All decisions come with trade-offs. New, immature technologies tend to be inefficient, and most technologies don't advertise their glaring flaws. Things that improve maintainability in one way can also hurt it worse in another way. [See quality attribute matrix for general examples]
Maintaining a healthy body and mind is paramount to being a good developer, and that requires sleep, exercise, nutrition, and ergonomics. Being a considerate person is extremely important, too (see assertion #1 above).
Guidelines, principles, and best practices are not rules; they're not perfect and are not meant to be the best answer in every situation. What's always best is to weigh your options in context. The same applies for tools, technologies, and methodologies. Additionally, they're very hard to study, so you can't be sure how much they help solely based on speculation of their pros and cons [https://accu.org/index.php/journals/1547]. [Some discussion of the dubious benefits of pair programming: https://accu.org/index.php/journals/1983] [Some discussion of the difficulties involved in agile: https://accu.org/index.php/journals/2003]
Best practices and principles include KISS [Keep It Stupid-Simple], SOLID [Single Responsibility; Open/Closed; Liskov Substitution; Interface Segregation; Dependency Inversion], DRY [Don't Repeat Yourself] [Cases to ignore DRY: https://accu.org/index.php/journals/2662], consistency, loose coupling (and dependency injection), leaky abstractions [https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/], logic and documentation locality... Facts include "nothing is as simple as it seems." [https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/03/04/nothing-is-as-simple-as-it-seems/]
New technologies give you new ways of thinking, so try out a lot of languages and libraries. MATLAB/OCTAVE work with vector operations (SIMD--single instruction multiple data) so you often don't have to loop (see also: LINQ, map, reduce); functional languages like Haskell make you rely less on the program state and more on passing data around; declarative languages like VHDL give you a chance to break out of the sequence mindset.
Read some books (The Design of Everyday Things Revised and Expanded Edition, https://github.com/accu-org/essential-books/wiki ), and blogs (ITHare.com, GamaSutra, ACCU.org journals, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/, maybe JoelOnSoftware.com) at different points in your life, not just technology-specific tutorials and articles.
Make improvement your responsibility. If you join a group and see that they have no overview-level documentation or list of common misunderstandings or anything to help newcomers get up to speed, it'll be helpful to everyone if you choose to be the one to create it.
Avoid interruptions. Every interruption resets your working memory, leading to a loss of 15-30 minutes of productivity.
Triple your initial estimates [http://programs.clearerthinking.org/how_well_anchored_are_your_estimates.html] or estimate with a confidence interval [https://accu.org/index.php/journals/1836]. Only make estimates for your own projects [https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/10/26/evidence-based-scheduling/], and break down projects that are more than a few days long to estimate them better. It's much easier to estimate how long something will take once you've actually thought about the challenges involved, but your estimates still need padded for bugs, interruptions, and test time.
Don't try to get even close to 100% automated test coverage in a non-safety-critical application. [http://ithare.com/too-much-unit-testing-is-detrimental-for-code-quality/] [http://ithare.com/testing-my-personal-take-on-testing-including-unit-testing-and-atddbdd/]
When writing code, especially if you don't have a formal design prepared in advance, write to-do comments explaining the process. You can take off the "TODO" as you complete these, and they become documentation of the intention behind sections of your code. This also serves as a guide and helps if you get interrupted or forget what you were doing.
Brainstorming consists of coming up with ideas and leaving their evaluation for later. [https://www.managers.org.uk/~/media/Files/Campus%20CMI/Checklists%20PDP/Brainstorming.ashx]
When you find a need to optimize your code (which requires first benchmarking to identify the slowest parts), first try reducing the run time complexity of the algorithms, such as changing a search into a hash-based lookup. If that proves insufficient, you may have to sacrifice clean, maintainable code for optimization. Compilers, particularly those for more mature programming languages, are very smart and capable of optimizing in a lot of ways, so you probably won't get anything out of simple changes [http://ithare.com/the-importance-of-back-of-envelope-estimates/]. However, compilers do not have problem domain knowledge and are restricted from performing some optimizations due to their general-purpose nature. In some cases, changing a class to a struct may result in a speed increase because it can increase cache locality and reduce redirection. Compilers for less mature languages may be unable to perform common optimizations like loop interchange and tail recursion. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimizing_compiler] [http://ithare.com/optimizing-big-number-arithmetic-without-sse/]
Fix bugs before implementing new features. Perform a proper root-cause analysis. Bugs can have hard-to-realize underlying causes that could affect new features. Their effects on other existing features could also go unnoticed.
If someone questions a piece of code, add a comment addressing their concern (or rephrase an existing comment if it helps), because chances are good someone else will question it for the same reason eventually.
Remember your potential numeric ranges and font sizes when designing visuals like pie charts (e.g. how can you fit a label on a 1% sliver?) and raw text displays (word wrap? Word break? Scrolling?).
**Metrics
**Requirements elicitation (ambiguity is the greatest evil), requirements documents, requirements tracking
**Job hunting
**Anti-patterns

Automate everything that reasonably can be automated, such as pulling the code and all the tools and dependencies (which helps new team members get up to speed), building, test execution (which can be run during check-in), code formatting (which can be run constantly or during the build process), static analysis, and publishing (including packaging resources). If it takes more than two tasks, it's probably too much work. This acts as documentation, reducing unspoken knowledge. Infrequent things are just as important to automate as frequent things because humans forget them more easily.
Think about everything.

//TODO: Go through the above items, check that they fit the project concept, and format them as code.
//TODO: Specify a standard for explanatory reasoning that doesn't qualify as a standalone knowledge item. (Basically, a Pop without a checkbox and with a "Why?" or "Examples" button instead of a "?" or whatever we settle on for references/external links to in-depth reasoning and examples.)
//TODO: Allow downloading + restoring the state of all your checkboxes (this feature plus the automatic localStorage one together, from the user's perspective, roughly equate to using a database while maintaining purely-local functionality for guaranteed privacy and offline use)
//TODO: Offer a link to continue where you left off (go to the most recently checked item)
//Wishlist: Voting, sorting, filtering, and searching (due to the collapsible categories). If I show them in random order until there are over 100 user votes on the importance of each of the items, then I can be temporarily confident that it's not a popularity contest (say, because I had a fixed order, most people would only read the first few items) or chance ordering.
